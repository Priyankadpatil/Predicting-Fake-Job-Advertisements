# Predicting-Fake-Job-Advertisements

In the era of digitalization, most of the recruitment process begins online. This has helped to reduce 
the hiring cost as well as to increase the reach to a potential job seeker. This makes job listing 
websites the go-to place for both employers as well as job seekers. This brings along a high cost 
of maintaining brand equity and viewership. A trusted website can easily lose its reputation due to 
poor customer satisfaction. One of the key factors for customer satisfaction on an online job portal 
is not being scammed while searching for a job. Generally, 65% of the consumers are more likely 
to avoid using a website with fake content.

Challenges were faced in calculating the brand value/brand equity. Therefore, an assumption was 
made that revenue per view reduction has a direct relation to the brand value. Negative review 
reach was calculated along with the positive review reach. The average price per ad per viewer 
was then used to calculate the total revenue impact because of the Fall in brand equity.
A job seeker usually spends 11-15 hours per week looking for a job. On average a person applies 
to 10 job applications per week. This can result in a critical loss of time for a job seeker if they fall 
prey to fake advertising. We see from our dataset that approximately 5% of the advertisements are 
fraudulent. This means it can cost a job seeker an hour of his week. 

As part of this project, we tried to analyze the cost of fake ads to brand equity. Recommendations 
were provided to improve customer satisfaction by safeguarding job seeker's information and 
saving their time.
